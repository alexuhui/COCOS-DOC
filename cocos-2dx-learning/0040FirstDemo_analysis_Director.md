#### 概念
```
Cocos2d-x uses the concept of a Director, just like in a movie! The Director object controls the flow of operations and tells the necessary recipient what to do. Think of yourself as the Executive Producer and you tell the Director what to do! One common Director task is to control Scene replacements and transitions. The Director is a shared singleton (effectively, there's only one instance of the class at a time) object that you can call from anywhere in your code.
Cocos2d-x采用了导演（Director）的概念，就像在电影中一样！导演对象控制操作的流程并告诉必要的接收者该做什么。想象一下自己是执行制片人，你告诉导演要做什么！一个常见的导演任务是控制场景替换和转场。导演是一个共享的单例（有效地控制同一时间只有一个类的实例），你可以在代码的任何地方调用它。
